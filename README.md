# DeepLearning101
My Deep Learning journey with Python, Jupyter Notebook and many other data science library.

# Lab Overview
| # | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/superzerosec/DeepLearning101/blob/main/notebook/Lab%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb) | Understanding every single component in neural network. |
| 2 | [Introduction to Autoencoders](https://github.com/superzerosec/DeepLearning101/blob/main/notebook/Lab%202%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Autoencoders.ipynb) | Understanding the idea of autoencoders which is to allow a neural network to figure out how to best encode and decode certain data. |
| 3 | [Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders](https://github.com/superzerosec/DeepLearning101/blob/main/notebook/Lab%203%20-%20Anomaly%20Detection%20with%20Autoencoders.ipynb) | Understanding how to train an autoencoder to detect anomalies on the ECG dataset. |
